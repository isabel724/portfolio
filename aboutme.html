<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>Today was actually pretty fun. I was able to do a topic that I genuinely enjoyed. Some parts were kind of difficult but eventually I was
 able to understand what to do. I didn't entirely finish everything I wanted to happen in my story but I still got a fair enough amount done.</p>
  
 
 <h2> Reflection</h2>
 <p> A list is information that you can easily get to by using brackets. 
  I worked best with Brittany because we both had so much common and got to express our love for Ed Sheeran. 
  
 <h2> Reflection</h2>
 <p> Today was really fun going to Refinery 29. It was very interesting to learn more about what they do and how they do those things. I liked getting
  to be part of the shop team where we got to see products and judge what we would want to change about it. I would have liked to actually see more of the 
  coding from the shop team on how they put everything up for everyone to see. As well, I would have just actually been able to see what the workers do 
  instead of just having them tell us what they do.
  
<h2> Reflection</2>
<p> Something I think I could have done better was to actually do some of the wiring and stuff myself. I understood what my group was doing I 
 just wish I could have done some more myself. As a group I thought we did well on being able to get what we wanted done. Granted sometimes it did
 take us awhile to do it but we did get everything we wanted to happen to actually happen.
