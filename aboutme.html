<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>Today was actually pretty fun. I was able to do a topic that I genuinely enjoyed. Some parts were kind of difficult but eventually I was
 able to understand what to do. I didn't entirely finish everything I wanted to happen in my story but I still got a fair enough amount done.</p>
  
 
 <h2> Reflection</h2>
 <p> A list is information that you can easily get to by using brackets. 
  I worked best with Brittany because we both had so much common and got to express our love for Ed Sheeran. 
  
 <h2> Reflection</h2>
 <p> Today was really fun going to Refinery 29. It was very interesting to learn more about what they do and how they do those things. I liked getting
  to be part of the shop team where we got to see products and judge what we would want to change about it. I would have liked to actually see more of the 
  coding from the shop team on how they put everything up for everyone to see. As well, I would have just actually been able to see what the workers do 
  instead of just having them tell us what they do.
  
<h2> Reflection</2>
<p> Something I think I could have done better was to actually do some of the wiring and stuff myself. I understood what my group was doing I 
 just wish I could have done some more myself. As a group I thought we did well on being able to get what we wanted done. Granted sometimes it did
 take us awhile to do it but we did get everything we wanted to happen to actually happen.
 
<h2> Reflection</h2>
<p> Today we had to remake the LED sensor that we did from yesterday. Then we got to use the sensor to also make a knight rider turn on from the sensor.
 Then we got to make our robot able to move forward, backwards, and be able to turn. I understood some of it but honestly I get the board and how it works, it's
 the coding that goes into making it work that sometimes confuses me.
 
<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p> Today we added a button to the robot and did a little bit with whisker wires. Again, I still was a bit confused but I got to read a little more about
 what we were doing and I think I get it a little better. However, still I want to be able to understand more so I'll probably just look up some more about 
 what we're doing when I get home.
     
<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p> Today we were able to have our LED's turn on by pressing different numbers for them to turn on and off. We also were then able to manually and have the robot
 on its own be able to move forward, backward, left and right. I was able to understand more today than I have these past couple of days. I actually looked up different
 things I didn't understand to make sure that I was still able to follow along as to what we were doing. I understand how we got the robot to move manually it's just the 
 way the robot moves on its own using the infrared sensor that still confuses me a bit. All in all, today I'm glad I got to understood more but it still is confusing to me
 sometimes.
 
<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p> Today we learned more about cybersecurity. I honestly think it's pretty interesting how people can hack into differerent things and be able tp block different attacks.
 It was kind of difficult to be code different things into javascript today. But, once I saw the code it makes sense it's just sometimes hard to first fugure it out on my own.

<h2> Reflection </h2>
<p> I honestly am very excited to start working on these final projects. I've had this idea to make something like this for a very long time. It's not entirely how 
 I planned it to be but I'm still very excited for what we are going to do. I think that our idea and our plan on how to do everything is very reasonable and be able to be
 accomplished throughout these last two weeks.

 <h2> Reflection </h2>
 <p> Today was good. I was able to understand what we were doing from yesterday and today about bubble sort and binary search.
