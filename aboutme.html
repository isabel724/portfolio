<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p>Today was actually pretty fun. I was able to do a topic that I genuinely enjoyed. Some parts were kind of difficult but eventually I was
 able to understand what to do. I didn't entirely finish everything I wanted to happen in my story but I still got a fair enough amount done.</p>
