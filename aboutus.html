This website was made by Nabeeha Anwar, Santana Laureano, Brittany Torres, and Isabel Serna. We are four students<br>
     in girls who code at Goldman Sachs. Nabeeha is a sixteen year old girl and goes to school at Fiorello H. <br>
  LaGuardia High School. Santana is a seventeen year old girl who goes to Columbia Secondary School for Math Science<br>
  and Engineering. Brittany Torres is a seventeen year old girl who goes to All City Leadership Secondary School. <br>
  Isabel Serna is a sixteen year old girl who goes to Roselle Park High Schoool. We made this website as an openly safe<br>
  place for people who have been through depression and still go through depression to goand cope throughtheir tough <br>
   times. The idea of this website came to us because some of us ourselves still deal with depression and have gone <br>
   through it. This website is filled with four different categories to go into. In interests you can go and look at <br>
   different interests people have such as Movies/ TV Shows, and types of Music. In Connect you can be able to login and <br>
   talk to others one on one. As well, there is a references page where we have different phone numbers for people to be<br>
   able to call and talk instantly. In the Express page you can be able to write anything you want.You can talk about how <br>
   you're feeling or your own stories as to how you became depressed. In the Profile page it is completely optional you can <br>
   put your name an a description about yourself. Our goal in this website is for people to be able to not feel like they<br>
   are alone. There are other people who have the same struggles that they can talk to and things they can do to cope from <br>
   when they are feeling depressed. The whole meaning of Metanoia is changing one's mind, heart, self, or way of life. It's <br>
   the journey of helping one get to a better path and that's our goal to help others.
